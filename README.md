Final thoughts
==============

This document is being written imediately after the dojo.

Overall, some liked the experience but it was not a consense, since it was not a TDD-driven dojo.  We decided that we should do more dojos using the regular approach.  
Felipe Lessa is likely to become the next sensei.
